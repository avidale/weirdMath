    "# A machine learning model to understand fancy abbreviations\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently I bumped into a [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43510778) on Stackoverflow, how to recover phrases from abbreviations, e.g. turn *wtrbtl* into *water bottle*, and *bsktball* into *basketball*. The question had an additional complication: lack of comprehensive list of word. That means, we need an algorithm able to invent new likely words.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was intrigued, and started researching, which algorithms and math lie behind modern spell-checkers. It turned out that a good spell-checker can be made with a n-gram language model, a model of word distortions, and a greedy beam search algorithm. The whole construction is called a [noisy channel](http://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/5.pdf) model. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this knowledge and Python, I wrote a model from scratch. After training on \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" text, it was able to recognize abbreviations of modern sports terms."

    "Spell checkers are widely used: from your phone's keyboard to search engines and voice assistants. It's not easy to make a good spell checker, because it has to be really fast and universal (able to correct unseen words) at the same time. That's why there is so much science in spell checkers. This article is aimed to give idea of this scince and just to make fun."

    "### Math behind a spell checker\n",
    "In the noisy channel model, each abbreviation is the result of a random distortion of the original phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "To recover the original phrase, we need to answer two questions: which original phrases are likely, and which distortions are likely?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By the Bayes theorem, $$p(phrase|abbreviation) \\sim p(phrase) p(abbreviation|phrase) = \\\\ = p(phrase) \\sum p(distortion|phrase) $$. Here $distortion$ is any change of the original $phrase$, which turns it into the observable $abbreviation$. The $\\sim$ symbol means \"proportional\", because LHS is a probability distribution, but RHS is generally not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both original phrase likelihood and distortion likelihood can be estimated with statistical models. I will use the simplest models - character n-grams(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram). I could use more difficult models (e.g recurrent neural networks), but it doesn't change the principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "With such models, we can reconstruct probable original phrases letter by letter, using a greedy directed search algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### N-gram language model\n",
    "\n",
    "N-gram model looks at the previous n-1 letters and estimates the probability of the next (n'th) letter conditional on them. For example, probability of letter \"g\" appearing after \"bowlin\" sequence would be calculated by 4-gram model as $p(g|bowlin)=p(g|lin)$, because the model ignores all the characters before these 4, for the sake of simplicity. Conditional probabilities, such as this, are determined (\"learned\") on a training corpus of texts. In my example,\n",
    "$$p(g|lin)=\\frac{\\#(ling)}{\\#(lin\\bullet)}=\\frac{\\#(ling)}{\\#(lina)+\\#(linb)+\\#(linc)+...}$$. \n",
    "Here #(ling) is number of occurences of \"ling\" in the training text. $\\#(lin\\bullet)$  is number of all 4-grams in the text, starting with \"lin\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to estimate correctly even the rare n-grams, I apply two tricks. First, for each counter I add a positive number $\\delta$. It guarantees that I will not divide by zero. Second, I use not only n-grams (which can occur rarely in the text), but also n-1 grams (more frequent), and so on, down to 1-grams (unconditional probabilities of letters). But I discount lesser-order counters with an $\\alpha$ multiplier. Thus, in fact I calculate $p(g|lin)$ as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(g|lin)=\\frac{(\\#(ling)+1) + \\alpha (\\#(ing)+1) + \\alpha^2 (\\#(ng)+1) + \\alpha^3 (\\#(g)+1)}{(\\#(lin\\bullet)+1) + \\alpha (\\#(in\\bullet)+1) + \\alpha^2 (\\#(n\\bullet)+1) + \\alpha^3 (\\#(\\bullet)+1)}$$\n",

The best candidate will be extended with multiple possible one-letter continuations, and added to the heap. To cut the number of options, I will save only the \"good enough\" candidates.

It makes sense to set \"optimism\" between 0 and 1; the closer it is to 1, the faster the algorithm will try to add new characters. \"Freedom\" is the allowable loss of quality in comparison to the curent best candidate. The higher the \"freedom\", the more options would be included, and the slower the algorithm would be. If the \"freedom\" is too low, the heap may deplete before any reasonable phrase is found."

    "Natural language processing is a complex mixture of science, technology, and magic. Even linguistic scientists cannot fully understand the laws of human speech. The times when machines indeed understand texts are not to come soon. \n",

    "Natural language processing is also fun. Armed with a couple of statictical models, you can both recognize and generate non-obvious abbreviations. For those who want to continue my playing with data, there is a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/avidale/weirdMath/blob/master/nlp/abbreviation_spellchecker_english.ipynb) with the complete code of the experiment. As for this blog, the other experiments will follow. So subscribe! :-)"
